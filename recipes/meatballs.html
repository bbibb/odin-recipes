        <h1>Italian Meatballs</h1>
        <img src="../images/meatball.jpg" alt="meatball">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a basic and delicious recipe for Italian meatballs. They are tender and flavorful, and wonderful on pasta or on a meatball sub!</p>
        <p>The recipe here uses ground beef, but you may also incorporate ground pork or ground turkey as you like. Also, I prefer to bake the meatballs and bag them for later use. However, you can also cook a small batch right within your pasta sauce.</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lb Ground beef</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1.5 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 cup Italian style breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1/2 yellow onion</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350F.</li>
            <li>Combine breadcrumbs and milk in a small bowl, set aside for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Finely chop/mince onion and garlic.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs.</li>
            <li>Combine all ingredients in a large bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Gently</strong> mix ingredients with your hands until there are no pockets of single ingredients. Do not overmix; the meat mixture will be uneven.</li>
            <li><strong>Gently</strong> form 2-inch balls, lightly rolling them in your palm to achieve a round shape.</li>
            <li>Place meatballs in a large sheet pan and bake 15-20 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160F. <i>Do not overbake!</i></li>
            <li>Immediately transfer to a plate for cooling. They can be eaten now or bagged and frozen for later.</li>
        </ol>
